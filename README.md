# OCRSpellChecker
This is a small demo for the automated spell checker for OCR text. 
This works on custom dictionary and correct the words based on that dictionary.

The words in the dictionry are made to a character bi-gram dictionary and each word are made into their bigram.
The set intersection is used for checking similarity between the words.

The padding spaces or extra space at begin or end of the word is used to improve the accuracy.
